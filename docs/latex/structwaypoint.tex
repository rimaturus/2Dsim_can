\doxysubsection{Detailed Description}
Plans the trajectory for the car based on its current state and detected obstacles. 

Represents a point in 2D space.

This function calculates the trajectory by considering the car\textquotesingle{}s position and orientation, as well as the positions of detected cones. The resultant waypoints are stored in the provided trajectory array.


\begin{DoxyParams}{Parameters}
{\em car\+\_\+x} & The x-\/coordinate of the car\textquotesingle{}s current position. \\
\hline
{\em car\+\_\+y} & The y-\/coordinate of the car\textquotesingle{}s current position. \\
\hline
{\em car\+\_\+angle} & The heading angle of the car in radians. \\
\hline
{\em detected\+\_\+cones} & Pointer to an array of cone structures representing detected cones. \\
\hline
{\em trajectory} & Pointer to an array of waypoint structures where the planned trajectory will be stored.\\
\hline
\end{DoxyParams}
This structure is used to define a waypoint with x and y coordinates.
